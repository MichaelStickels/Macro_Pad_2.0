## Description

After really enjoying my [first DIY macro keypad](https://github.com/MichaelStickels/Macro_Keypad), I set out to create a second iteration of my own unique design that incorporated even more features. Mainly, I wanted to combine custom macro functionality with slide potentiometers for per-app volume control with Deej.

### Features

- 9 fully programmable custom macro keys
- 3 volume sliders for use with Deej
- Fully customizable RGB and onboard button
- Easily change settings with almost any text editor
- USB C interface
- Mechanical switches
- No driver needed
- Open source

### Built with

- CircuitPython
- Love

## Building One Yourself


### PCB Files

Standard PCB Gerber files are [here](https://github.com/MichaelStickels/Macro_Pad_2.0/tree/main/PCB%20Order%20Files). Simply upload these files to the custom PCB manufacturer of your choice to order one for yourself. This project only needs a very basic 2 layer PCB, I recommend white to really show off the RGB!
